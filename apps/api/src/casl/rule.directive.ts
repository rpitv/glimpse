/**
 * Injectable class for defining the GraphQL directives that can be used to apply CASL rules to a field. This is an
 *  underlying implementation. In reality, you'll probably want to use the {@link Rule} decorator instead, which
 *  is just a type-safe wrapper for applying these directives. Thus, you may find more complete documentation within
 *  the {@link Rule} decorator.
 *
 * These directives can only be applied to GraphQL resolvers, not HTTP controllers. If you need to apply rules to an
 *  HTTP controller, you will need to implement an interceptor which calls the underlying logic within
 *  {@link CaslHelper}. For a partial implementation, see the old @Rule decorator implemented with an interceptor at
 *  {@link https://github.com/rpitv/glimpse-api/tree/03f73f9db27959b07ad83028ae4521187b153ba6/src/casl}. This
 *  interceptor was deprecated and removed due to being untested and not being needed. For more information, please
 *  read the wiki.
 *
 * @see {@link https://github.com/rpitv/glimpse-api/tree/03f73f9db27959b07ad83028ae4521187b153ba6/src/casl}
 * @see {@link https://github.com/rpitv/glimpse-api/wiki/Authorization}
