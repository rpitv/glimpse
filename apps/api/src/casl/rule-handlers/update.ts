/**
 * Handle a {@link Rule} definition with rule type {@link RuleType.Update}. This function ensures that the user has
 *  permission to update a resource of the given type, and intercepts the returned value from the resolver/handler
 *  that it is applied to, to make sure the user has permission to read that specific value. This is done by
 *  wrapping this method in the {@link this#readOneRuleHandler} method.
 *
 *  The current user's permissions are determined by the {@link Express.Request#permissions} property within the
 *  current NestJS execution context. The {@link CaslInterceptor} is expected to have already initialized this
 *  value.
 *
 *  If the user does not have permission to read or update the resource, then this method sets
 *  {@link Express.Request#passed} to false on the context's request object and returns null, potentially before
 *  calling the handler. From there, the {@link CaslInterceptor} will see that {@link Request#passed} is false and
 *  throw an error. {@link Express.Request#passed} can also be set to false by the resolver/handler that this rule
 *  is applied to, which stops the rule checks and immediately returns back to the {@link CaslInterceptor}.
 *
 *  Options can be supplied to this function to change the behavior of the rule checks within the {@link RuleDef}
 *  argument.
 *
 * @todo Support toggling strict mode?
 *
 * @see {@link RuleOptions}
 * @see {@link https://github.com/rpitv/glimpse-api/wiki/Authorization}
 *
 * @typeParam T - The type of the value expected to be returned by the resolver/handler which this rule is being
 *  applied to. Currently, this must be an instance of a valid {@link AbilitySubjects} type. This requirement may
 *  no longer be required.
 * @param context - NestJS execution context.
 * @param rule - Rule to test. If rule type is {@link RuleType.Custom}, an error will be thrown.
 * @param handler - The handler that calls the request method/resolver, or the next rule/interceptor in line if
 *  applicable. This is called after the necessary rule checks pass, and then additional checks are applied to the
 *  return value.
 * @returns The value returned from the handler, or null if the rule checks fail. This rule handler does not ever
 *  mutate the return value from the next handler.
 * @throws Error if the rule type is {@link RuleType.Custom}.
 * @throws Error if the current user's permissions are not initialized.
