Assets are the physical objects that are property of RPI TV, or are otherwise managed and tracked by RPI TV.

Due to the club's rapidly revolving door of members, it's easy for equipment to get lost or forgotten about. The
Asset system is intended to assist in keeping track of what assets RPI TV owns, where they were purchased, how
much they were purchased for, and where they are being used (and by whom).

Assets currently do not have a "checked in" or "checked out" status. Instead, each asset has a last known location,
as well as the last known user who was using the asset. When an asset is "checked out", the user will scan the
location's bar code and the asset's QR code, which will update the asset's last known location and last known
handler. It is presumed that an asset will not be checked out for long, or if it is, the user who checked it out
will have it in their possession at all times, so they will know the status of it while it is in their possession.
When the user wants to "check in" the asset, the same process is done as when they checked it out.

Audit logs are used to track changes to resources within the database. At the moment, Prisma does not have an elegant
way of generating these automatically with the user's ID. It would be possible to generate automatically if we
weren't logging the user who made the change using Prisma middleware or extensions. For now, they have to be
logged manually using {@link PrismaServicegenAuditLog }.

All automatic generation solutions that I came up with involved violating type safety, relying on private Prisma
